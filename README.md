Voleeyo is a Volunteer WebApp that aims to help volunteers connect and contribute to society. This is a V1 proof of concept for the platform.

## Installation

1. Run `npm i` to install the necessary dependencies.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
3. In the `.env` file, save the following two environment variables:
    - `baseUri`: The base URI for the API endpoints.
4. run `npm i` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the application on your localhost settings.
5. Enjoy Voleeyo!

## Conclusion

Voleeyo is a work in progress, but we hope that it will help connect volunteers with the organizations and causes that they are passionate about. We will continue to improve and expand the platform in future versions.
